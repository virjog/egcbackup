									the year is designingand building a model plane for our
									annual UAV competition, where we must have our plane 
									navigate a course on its own while completing other 
									tasks. Doing this allows members to get hands on 
									experience with the design and construction of planes 
									and puts material learned in class to practical 
									purposes. The UAV competition is an international 
									competition run by AUVSI and sponsored by many 
									different Aerospace and defense companies. We provide 
									students with one of the only projects on campus to 
									design and build autonomous equipment, which gives 
									engineers and everyone involved a unique opportunity
