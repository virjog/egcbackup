<h2> What is the Engineering Governing Council? </h2> <hr>
	
	<p> The Engineering Governing Council is the representative body 
	for the students of the Rutgers University School of Engineering. 
	Working in conjunction with the faculty and administration of the 
	School of Engineering, the EGC strives to represent and further 
	the needs and best interests of its constituency. Additionally,
 	the EGC works in parallel with University administration and other
  	student Governing Associations to help give students at Rutgers 
  	University a stronger voice as a whole. </p>
  		
  	 
  	<h2> When are the meetings? </h2> <hr>

	rotating between general and committee meetings. 
	Also, the Executive Board holds meetings on Sundays at 5:00PM
	in the Busch Student Center Room 122A. All EGC meetings are open to the public.  </p>
