					Approximately a week ago, the EGC was honored to have Ms. Elizabeth O'Connell-Ganges come and speak about her new role as Executive Director of Student Centers and Programs. In addition to relating the challenges inherent in unifying a previously decentralized system with varying policies and procedures, she also spoke to the wisdom of creating a new coordinated Student Center Department. In particular, she offered promising glimpses into the new efficiencies which have, and will continue, to spring out of the newly synchronized system.<br />

					The EGC has also been quite busy internally, passing several resolutions and bills, among them, a resolution which recognized our first new society this year - Materials Advantage. Our congratulations and best wishes go out to this newly formed student organization. In addition to the paper work, we have been busy in the community as well:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>Spearheading and coordinating departmental tours for interested freshman</li>
						<li>Establishing a Quiet-Study room in ARC for late-night studyers</li>
						<li>Conducting the first School of Engineering T-shirt design competition</li>
						<li>Creating an online option to register comments about deferred maintenance</li>
						<li>Putting together an Academic Bowl (Engineering Jeopardy) event</li>
						<li>Organizing a Society Presidents meeting</li>
					</ul>
					Finally, please keep your eyes and ears open throughout the month of November as the EGC, in conjunction with all the other student governing bodies at Rutgers, New Brunswick Campus, will be holding the first ever "What's on your mind month?". It is our goal to reach as many students as possible and elicit comments and suggestions towards the improvement of our university. Please feel free to approach us at any time, and don't feel shy to tell us what's on your mind!<br />
