					The EGC has had several meetings over the last month in preparation for September's abundance of events. Particularly, we have been working hard to plan for the Freshman Convocation (September 14th), the Rutgers University Involvement Fair (September 9th), and our Fall Retreat (September 28th-30th). However, perhaps most exciting have been our new Freshman Outreach initiatives spearheaded by First Year Events Chair, David Chin. In addition to holding a competition night (September 6th) and Meet and Greet (September 13th), both in Barr Hall, we are also working feverishly to construct a student-created Student Handbook, which will be inserted as a move-in material for engineers living in the Barr Hall Dormitory. As a side note, an electronic version will also be available for freshman engineers not living in Barr Hall and all Barr Hall events will be open to the entire freshman engineering class. We greatly anticipate a stronger connection with our new constituency, and look forward to serving all students to the best of our abilities.<br />
