					Welcome Back! September has been an exciting month here at the School of Engineering. In addition to planning, creating, and printing nearly 700 copies of freshman handbooks and putting on two freshman-oriented community events, the EGC has been hard at work in several other areas of the community. In particular, the EGC co-hosted the Engineering Convocation with the School of Engineering Dean's Office last Friday (September 14th). Nearly 400 freshman students came out to the event and had the opportunity to meet 21 of our active societies, win great prizes, and get their hands on lots of free School of Engineering merchandise.<br />
					<br />
					In addition to student programming, the EGC has begun its representative and legislative work as the council has had its first general and committee meetings. Dean of Busch Campus, Jeffrey Rankin, honored us by coming to speak at our first council meeting on September 10th regarding his additional administrative role. Additionally, the freshman representative election process is now under way. Petitions were handed out at the Convocation and due last Friday at the candidates meeting. Because we hope to have a record high voting turnout, the Publicity Committee is hard at work on advertising the election. In particular, freshman should expect a BAMM outdoor barbeque this Tuesday (25th).<br />
					<br />
					Finally, the EGC retreat will be held this month from September 28th to September 30th at Camp Birnie. During the retreat, accommodations, food, and fun activities will be provided free of charge for all members. All council members are required to attend.<br />
