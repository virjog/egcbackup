<img src="06-07/const.jpg" align="right">The <a href="mailto:ktevis@eden.rutgers.edu" class="email">University Affairs Committee</a> is currently reviewing a proposed Constitution for how next year's student government will be structured. The undergraduate colleges will be consolidated into the School of Arts and Sciences next fall, and as such, the structure of student government needs to change to address this. The proposed Constitution was created by a committee of student government presidents and board members, and had the imput of over 50 student leaders.The major changes proposed in this document are to centralize student government with a "Rutgers University Student Assembly" (RUSA), and convert the college governing associations to campus councils. The professional school councils, like EGC, will remain largely unchanged.<br />
<br />
Click <a href="06-07/RUSA.doc" class="link"> here </a>to view the Constitution. The EGC will be discussing this proposal at its Council meetings throughout the remainder of this semester. If the EGC chooses to approve the Constitution, it will be sent to the students of the University for final approval.
