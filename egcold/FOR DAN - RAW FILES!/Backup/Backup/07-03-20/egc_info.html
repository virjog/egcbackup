	The Engineering Governing Council is the representative body for the students of the Rutgers University School of Engineering. Working in conjunction with the faculty and administration of the School of Engineering, the EGC strives to represent and further the needs and best interests of its constituency. Additionally, the EGC works in parallel with University administration and other student <a href="http://nbpweb.rutgers.edu/menus/studgov.shtml" target="_blank">Governing Associations</a> to help give students at Rutgers University a stronger voice as a whole.
