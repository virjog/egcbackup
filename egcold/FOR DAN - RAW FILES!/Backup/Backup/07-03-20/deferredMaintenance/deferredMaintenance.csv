Divya Harjani,2008,042000450,OffCampus,Busch,Aesthetics,,Near Hill Center,There is a lot of graffiti under the staircase near Hill Center. Brian Spatocco,2008,spatocks,Busch,Busch,Other,Bathroom ,SERC,The second floor men\'s bathrooms are absolutely atrocious. They are flooded and poorly maintained.Alexandra Bancroft,2010,bancrofa,Cook,Cook,Other,Saftey Concerns,Newell Apartments,In my Newell, the electrical sockets in my living room stick out of the wall, and sometimes when you pull an appliance out of the socket, it short-circuits the entire apartment. Also, sometimes our main door doesn\'t close.Andrew Matejek,2009,matejeka,OffCampus,College Avenue,Other,Bathrooms,FH,There are NO soap dispensers in ANY Men\'s room.Andrew Matejek,2009,matejeka,OffCampus,Busch,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,Sidewalks,The problem is flooding.  Why are sidewalks pooling with water when it rains?  Don\'t we have a few Civil Engineers around here? Let\'s get that fixed.Andrew Matejek,2009,matejeka,OffCampus,Busch,Technology,,DSV Computers,The computers in the DSV Lab can no longer handle the load of software that needs to be installed on them. This leaves little operating room for the programs that need to save to the hard drive, i.e. Ansys.  Who votes on the budget for that kind of thing.  We desperately need new computers in there. Let\'s ask the football team for some donations.Zach Daroff,2011,zdaroff,Busch,Busch,Technology,,Barr Hall - Room 202 (probably the entire dorm),The RUTV connection in my room (along with several other people\'s rooms) has quite a bit of interference, likely due to poor cable shielding on the cables leading to the dorm building. This problem isn\'t visible on normal TV screens, but through PC-tuner cards, the issue is clearly visible. A predominantly white screen will develop terrible static noise with warped video, and some channels (not all) will have unusual waves of lines flying up and down them. I\'m certain this is not a problem with my PC card, as other people on my floor who also have tuner cards also experience the same exact problem in their own rooms.Hadi Halim,2008,hdhalim,OffCampus,Busch,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,ENB D-115,The HVAC system in this room is definitely not working properly. Since there are computers located inside, the room heat up very rapidly. Unfortunately, either the HVAC system is not working properly or don\'t have the appropriate capacity to handle the heating load there. It is very hot inside..Kah-Lai Colin Fong,2010,c010n31,Busch,Busch,Furniture,,Kitchen of Silvers 183,None of the drawers have tracks so that instead of coming out when they are pulled, they slide out and then fall down if they are not being held, creating a very annoying hassle every time anyone wants anything from the drawer.Joe Mazur,2010,069001826,Busch,Busch,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,Outside Busch Dining Hall,Everytime it rains, the water accumulates into a flood outside of the Busch Dining Hall on the walkway.  Because of this, students tend to walk in the dirt next to the walkway which then turns to mud and gets very slippery.Meghpara, Melissa,2010,meli,Busch,Busch,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Richarson Apts #160,The apt is incredibly hot despite the fact that the heat is not on. Apparently the air conditioning is off, but it should really be for us to control that not the campus.Francis Dintino,2008,fdintino,Livingston,Livingston,Technology,,North tower elevators,I know that this is a well-known problem, but nearly every other night at least one of the elevators in the north tower stops functioning until presumably an elevator mechanic fixes it. Since they are rarely fixed on weekends, there have been occasions where Sunday night both elevators were out of service, and students returning from home would have to carry their luggage up 7 or 8 flights of stairs.Harshil Patel,2011,hpatel29,Busch,Busch,Other,Bathroom,Mattia Hall,On the first floor\'s bathroom one of the stalls doors has broken and never was replaced.David W. Smith,2009,049005639,OffCampus,Busch,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,Courtyard near Ceramics building,The white decorative pavers are sticking up out of the ground.  Someone could/will trip on these.  Please make them flush.

Thanks.Justine Emili,2011,justinee,Douglass,Douglass,Bus Stops,,Smaller Bus Stops,It would be helpful to have NextBus tickers at all New Brunswick / Piscataway Bus Stops, not just large hub stops like Scott Hall, College Hall, or the various student centers.Warren Schmidt,2008,048000761,OffCampus,Busch,Structural Issues,,Biomedical Engineering Building,The entrance doors are excessively difficult to open.Angelica Abdool,2009,112008243,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Other,Basic Resident Services,Demarest Hall, College Ave,My dorm room doesn\'t have a working phone, this is a safety issue  because cell phones don\'t work in my room. If a situation arises where I need to call the cops I can\'t. A situation arised last year, and I\'m terrified that if it happens again I won\'t be able to call for help.

Both my roomate and I have been to the Housing Office to have this fixed several times, and nothing has happened.David W. Smith,2009,049005639,OffCampus,Busch,Furniture,,Biomedical Engineering building,In room BME 102, many of the seat covers (bottom-side) are falling off.  Looks like screws were never installed initially, but some of those that were repaired are already falling off again (screws too short?).

Also, some of the desk pivots are very loose.

Thanks.kathleen cammidge,2008,10408597,OffCampus,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,all building,classrooms are frequently the wrong temperature...too hot in winter and too cold in late summer/early fall. this just seems like a big waste of energy.Joanne Rejevich,Oct 2008,joannec,OffCampus,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Scott Hall and Murray Hall,Heat is way too high- we often have to open windows in the middle of winter-and classes still too hot. This is not efficient use of energy- if Rutgers is indeed concerned about the environnment and energy consumption, let\'s get this fixed. Waste of $ too!Michelle Bai,2008,mbai@eden.rutgers.edu,Busch,Busch,Technology,,Busch Campus Center,Busch Campus Center definitely needs more power outlets, especially in the Quiet Lounge. There have been many times when I had to move to somewhere else to use my laptop for the lack of power outlets. Rebecca Lemmel,2010,069001938,CollegeAve,Livingston,Structural Issues,,Warehouse Road,Warehouse Road is home to many storage facilities such as the Geology Museum Warehouse.  This was put up in World War II as a temporary building that is still being used everyday.  When I first saw it I didnt think that it was actually being used.  I actually volunteer now.  They need better climate conditions and safer conditionsJoanne Rejevich,Oct 2008,joannec,OffCampus,College Avenue,Other,Lighting,in the open common ground by Murray, Scott, Art Museum,There are many lights that are out. This is not good for security and safety with many students taking night classes. They have been out for quite some time now. If RU is indeed concerned about the safety of its students, these lights should be working. They are beautiful lamposts that are dark!Michelle Bai,2008,mbai@eden.rutgers.edu,Busch,Busch,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,ARC,Classrooms in ARC are always freezing. Usra Hussain,2010,Usrah@eden.rutgers.edu,Busch,Busch,Aesthetics,,Silvers 279,We have tried numerous times to contact the maintenance department to fix the infinite problems we have had since the beginning of the year. Although they did replace our refrigerator, we still have many problems with our apartment. We had someone come and take care of the spackle on the wall; they said they would be back within two days to paint it.  That hasn’t happened yet and it’s been over a month and a half.  The surrounding silvers buildings have been refurbished with new furniture and painted walls, our building has not been taken care of even though we pay the SAME amount of money for housing.
 
These are a few of our main concerns regarding out apartment.

- Paint is chipping in the living room and bedrooms
- Tiles on the ground are peeling
- Carpet is burnt 
- Couches are ripped
- Storage room has leaks


PLEASEEEE  TRY TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS OVER BREAK WE\'VE BEEN CALLING SINCE THE BEGINING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR!!!! pleaseeeee!!!2009,,CollegeAve,Livingston,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,The Whole Campus,There are stones missing all over the place and the paving is terrible.Jonathan Reichel,soph/jun,053004874,OffCampus,Busch,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,DSV lab; EIT lab,The DSV lab was overly chilly in the summer - to survive our 3-hour lab, my classmates and I needed to bring sweatshirts and jackets despite it being hot and sunny outside!  I don\'t think this has been addressed.

EIT was overly hot during the summertime (now it\'s OK because opening a window is pretty effective)Nick Ehlert,2010,066002515,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Furniture,,Brett 303,Both my and my roommate\'s desks have been without the right hand drawer above the chair space since the beginning of the year. We filled out a form at the beginning of the year, and someone left a tag on our door saying the drawer was back ordered and we\'d get one as soon as some got in. Several weeks later there was a large caddy full of these drawers in the 1st floor lounge, but we weren\'t given any. I went to the housing office in Clothier and asked again about the drawers, and they told me that there currently weren\'t any available. Is this ever going to be fixed?Melanie Schneider,2010,Melschne,Busch,Busch,Technology,,Busch Suites,There is no knight express swipe for our washers, dryers, or vending machines. The main reason I put money on my knight express is to use for laundry, which is extremely convenient. I was very disappointed when I moved into the suites this year and discovered that using the money for laundry was not possible. It is not fair to advertise this service and not inform people that it is not offered everywhere.OffCampus,Douglass,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,DDDC/Old Gibbons,The sidewalks in this area are crooked and cracked -- it is very easy to lose balance/trip. Laura Matilsky,2008,039005208,OffCampus,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Hickman Hall, Scott Hall, Ruth Adams and others,All of these buildings need their heating systems checked. They are often intrusively noisy and either freezing cold or unbearably hot. This environment is not conducive to good learning...
Samantha Thomas,,117006814,Livingston,Livingston,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Quad 3 House 37,Since it has turned cold out I have noticed that the rooms are excesively warm.  I constantly have to open a window to cool the room off.Samantha Thomas,,117006814,Livingston,College Avenue,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,Walkway from Library to Tillet,During this semester I was on crutches and the uneven broken up pavement was extremely unsafe. I slipped several times and fell once. Samantha Thomas,Sophmore,117006814,Livingston,Livingston,Other,Trash Shoot,Quad 3 House 37 3rd Floor,The trash shoot does not shut and makes the entire floor smell like garbage.Danielle Gal,2011,gal,Livingston,Livingston,Aesthetics,,quad 2, house 24, ground floor,our bathroom are disgusting. also sometimes the drying machine doesn\'t dry properlyDanielle Coniglio,2009,016000768,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Rockoff Hall,Walls were not painted prior to move in and carpets were not cleaned. I have lived in Douglass my first two years and both of these things had been done prior to move in day.College Avenue,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,in front of the Easton Ave apartments and stores (verizon, moda salon, southwest),The sidewalk is very uneven, and dangerous.  Several people have tripped/twisted their ankles.Vidhi Jain,sophomore,vijain,OffCampus,Cook,Other,Restrooms,Hickmann hall,The women rest rooms don\'t have locks on them. The toilets are also not in a good condition. The rest rooms need attention. The cook douglass campus in itself needs maintainence. The classes also need to be taken care of.Cindy Martinez,2012,cindym,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Clothier,During the last academic year 06-07 there was no heat in clothier hall!!  I believe there was a combined 2 weeks of working heat throughout the entire winter.  Maintenance could not fix the problem and offered to move students but most did not move.  It was a horrible experience.EJ Nicolas,2011,115005360,Douglass,Douglass,Bus Stops,,Red Oak Lane,This is one of the principle bus stops for Douglass campus and it\'s very unfortunate that there isn\'t a nextbus.com LCD sign. Please make it a priority to place one there. Cindy Martinez,2012,cindym,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Aesthetics,,Campbell Hall,Garbage bins on the first floor give a disgusting smell every time you walk into the building.  Also, there are HUNDREDS of spiders on the balcony in the lounges.  This is disturbing, they get inside of the building and build webs in the lounge curtains and I have even seen them under the couches.Anonymous,2009,123,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Other,Employees,Rockoff Hall,Why whenever I see the employees that work in or around Rockoff Hall, they\'re always sleeping or sitting around doing nothing? Do we need hundreds of employees to sit around and do nothing, or can we finally start reclaiming some of our NEEDED professors and course offerings?Leqi Sun,2008,097007239,OffCampus,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Alexander Library,The undergraduate computer lab is way too hot!Marc,2008,marcfaci,Livingston,Livingston,Other,Elevator Breakdowns,South Tower - Livingston Campus,The elevators constantly breakdown.  I do not remember a time that both elevators have been operating at the same time.  On the weekend the elevators both seem to break.  There have been numerous complaints and concerns about the inconvenience but nothing has been done.  This is my 4th year living in the Towers and third year as an RA and no one seems to want to fix this ongoing problem.  It is difficult for all the residents to operate with 1 elevator and in some cases no elevators in an 8 story residence hall.     Samantha Gross,2010,samgross,Douglass,Douglass,Other,Security Issues,New Gibbons A-3,The main door entering the A-3 building has been having problems properly locking after being shut. The door must be checked after being shut because it will not always automatically lock.John Coleman,Senior,032002811,Busch,Busch,Furniture,,Nichols 4,Kitchen Cabinets are in poor condition and need of replacement.Lauren Bierema,2009,018008593,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,vorhees hall,It is very cold in Vorhees and it makes it hard to pay attention during class.

Is there any way we could get that lit upSpencer F Young,2010,111006814,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Other,Bathroom,Hardenburgh Hall Dorm 1st floor,I spoke to housing about the leaking shower head, and the wastage of water (if it is in my shower, it must be in many other showers on campus).

When you turn the valve on for shower, there should be no water coming out, but the water drips.

It may seem like a small problem, but water adds up.

Rutgers should fix it.Matthew Mehesy,2009,mmehesy,OffCampus,Cook,Grounds/Landscaping/Signs,,Loree facing Passion Puddle,Paths leading up to the building have a lot of leaves on them. Since has rained a lot recently, it is very slippery. I have slipped at least twice and I have seen other people slip too.

Our whole screen is popped out from our living room window.Kimberly,2009,kgermek,Cook,Douglass,Other,Flooding,Jameson Studio Theatre,Most of the radiators in the space are leaking. Although some you can fit a bucket under, some you just have to let drip onto the stage. Every night the stage needs to be wet vac\'d and within the hour the puddle fondly known as \'Lake Jameson\' returns. One of the radiators leaks and the water flows down onto the stage, creates a puddle on the right side of the stags, goes under the audience risers, and seeps through the asbestos tiles creating a new puddle under the floating tiles. It is hot water coming from the radiators. Facilities has been called every  night this week to look at the problem, and no solution has been found. I spend a great deal of my class time trying to clean up the leaking water. College Avenue,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,busch lot 48,MAJOR POT HOLES!Kimberly,2009,kgermek,Cook,Douglass,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Little Theatre,There is little to no heat in Little Theatre.

I had one drop down in front of me in the middle of class and it wasn\'t a pleasnat experience, I\'m not a fan of spiders and I do get some reaction if I am bitten. Also, the ceiling tiles in the classroom need repair or to be replaced it looks as if there is water damage.Michelle Legemaat,2011,116001361,Livingston,Livingston,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,North Tower Dorms,I know that a lot of other people on the floor are experiencing the same problem.

I personally have been stuck in the elevators twice. The first time, I needed the help of Emergency Services and the other time, I had to jump up and down for about ten minutes in order for the elevator doors to open. I am not the only person who has had this experience, but I don\'t know if anyone else is willing to spend the time to send this message.Orry Katz,2009,117007232,OffCampus,College Avenue,Other,Bathroom Hygene,Men\'s bathroom in lecture hall section of Scott Hall,The smell in the bathroom in the lecture hall section of Scott Hall is absolutely repulsive.

Considering the amount of money that students pay in parking passes every year, combined with the fact that it is one of only three lots that students can even park in, I\'m surprised that it has gotten this bad without being fixed.  If someone hasn\'t wound up with a flat tire already, they will.Ruchi Pandya,2008,rpandya,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Any Classroom,I think that the inconsistency of the heating/air conditioning from classroom to classroom is horrible.

            My bed is sqeaky, uncomfortable and lopsided.  The left side of the mattress is significantly more worn in than the right, which is hurting my back and causes frustration when i try to roll over and find myself sliding back to the left side of the bed, into the only position that the mattress permits me.  I am a slave to over-worn springs.  My roommate and I had to reassemble part of the bedframe because of the loud squeaking that would result from moving at all while laying on it.  That helped a little.  If you could find it in your hearts to provide adequate bedding for future students, it would go a long way to preventing the frustration that I am forced to experience, as well as S-shaped spines for all posterity.

A sign stating the parking lot number would be extremely useful, because whenever a student calls the RU PD they ask which lot you are in if the incident is automobile related, and the number is not posted, which leads to misunderstandings and wasted time.

I know this hsa been an issue before, and I also know you put new sewage there in the spring (I think). Some other work in thare would greatly improve it.

Thanks!Michelle Baptiste,2010,manib34,Livingston,Livingston,Other,Pest Control,Beck/Tillett/Quads,I am under the impression that Beck Hall has an infestation of bugs. One day this impression was confirmed. I walked up the stairwell one morning and saw what looked like a flying daddy long-leg on the wall. At first I didn\'t think anything of it until I left the classroom and there were about 15 more of where that bug came from in the hallway as I walked down the stairs. Later that day I was sitting in the classroom and sure enough another one of them was flying around the classroom. So I decided to move to another class room so I could concentrate on my studies. The only available room was one on the basement floor full of flies. I was extremely disgusted. Not to mention that the first week of school in my Quad room a silver fish pranced along my ceiling and later that week my roommate encountered on as well. Lastly, one Sunday afternoon as I came out the computer lab I encountered what appeared to be an over sized millipede/centipede walking casually across the hallway. By then I was extremely disgusted with the pest issues I have been noticing.

This is the first time ever in my entire year and a half as a student that I\'ve ever felt like I have voice, as in despite of having had this complaint for almost 2 full semesters I never knew to whom I should report it to.  My complaint has to do with access from Hickman Hall to the northern side of George Street, right next to where the George Street pedestrian overpass is located.  As anyone who has class on Douglass can attest to, George Street along this section of campus can at times be EXTREMELY busy, time-consuming, and difficult to cross.  However, for anybody headed to Hickman Hall coming from the Ruth Adams Building, the Biological Sciences building, or from any other building in this section of the campus between the river and George Street, they find that they have cross over George Street and then cross back over again using the pedestrian overpass because there is an impassable metal fence seperating Hickman Hall from the sidewalk on the northern side of George Street right by the pedestrian overpass.  I have seen no evidence of why this fence should be there, nor any evidence of ongoing construction, and at various times throughout the three semesters in which I have attended Rutgers have seen the fence ripped down, presumably by angry students such as myself frusturated at having to cross over George Street and then cross back over again because of this fence, only to see the fence repaired and once again hindering pedestrian mobility.  Please, do hundreds of students a favor and permanently remove this fence seperating Hickman Hall from the northern George Street sidewalk and the rest of the buildings in the Antilles Field area.

Please fix it.  thank youRadoslaw Kielczewski,2009,radek87,OffCampus,Livingston,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,Livingston Campus,I have been a Livingston College student since fall 2005 and ever since then I have been appalled at the condition of the sidewalks on the campus. I am especially disappointed with the condition of the sidewalk between the Student Center and Tillett Hall.  It\'s not like the walk has cracks; instead, there are gaping holes where the sidewalk looks like it has exploded. Also, I am very dissatisfied with the standing water problem on the campus. On multiple occasions, during or after rain, I have stepped in puddles which have totally soaked my feet. Also, the asphalt walk between Beck Hall and the Student Center looks like total shit. The path makes the university look cheap since it looks like a feeble attempt to solve some kind of path path issue. To be honest, I think all of Livingston Camps looks like it was in need of dire repair about twenty years ago. Screw the College Ave. greening project and the sub-par football team and put our money to some better use. I am tired of seeing Livingston being continually screwed out of funds it should have received a long time ago. 
Another gripe I have is the sheer incompetence of our maintenance people. For example, whenever it snows it seems to me like the grass gets more plowing then the sidewalk. Also, the parking lot turns into a ice rink after it is plowed; what\'s the deal with that? Another example of incompetence which I have noticed came to my attention last week. Someone had the bright idea to back up a truck over wet grass to one of the tower residence halls. Great job they did; the truck\'s tires destroyed the grass. Also, the Livingston College sign looks like it faded ten years ago. I can go on forever writing about this stuff but I neither have the time nor patience. In short, less money towards football and more money where it counts cause some things make us look like shit.Kristina Volwieder,2006/2008,krisvolw@rutgers.edu,OffCampus,College Avenue,Other,Restrooms,Scott Hall,There are three women\'s and gent\'s toilets per floor in Scott Hall, making for a grand total of six toilets per gender on both floors.  Yet they are overused for more than 12 hours per week day, and thus do not satisfy in any way our current needs.

Moreover, the state of the ladies\' lavatories/toilets in the restrooms in Scott Hall are a health hazard to students.  Often, they do not flush properly, sometimes they overflow.  Even washing one\'s hands with warm/hot water and soap, a basic health requirement, is impossible.  There simply isn\'t any.

Attending to this problem is NOT optional, NOR is it a luxury for Rutgers University.  If nothing is done to maintain and improve the facilities, a request for inspection based on concerns of violation of state health and safety standards should be initiated at the state level.

I would appreciate Rutgers University facilities and maintenance staff attending to this concern immediately.

Thanks for listenting.

Anna Sherman,2010,080001918,OffCampus,College Avenue,Other,Security and Parking,Everywhere,I would like to voice my concern for the well being of everyone. There are a lot of crime alerts, but there are even more crimes that are not reported. Why? Because no one wants to go through all the trouble of placing a complaint that won\'t be solved. Does this mean Rutgers will pretend they do not exist? 
It should not take more crime to occur to have more security. Are there cameras in all the parking lots? Is there security around buildings and parking lots? Maybe, but none that I have seen. Maybe set up an easier way of reporting crimes like in a website like this one and publicize it. If its just about getting a tally of the events then that could be a better way. 
People feels its pointless since the crimes are never solved, but if it means there could be more security then maybe change will come. Students pay enough for parking that they should be able to get back to them safely.Nidhi Shah,2011,nidshah,Busch,Busch,Bus Stops,,Davidson, L.S.M., others,There are no ETAs on some of these bus stops.

The entire section really needs to be repaved. Also, there is a really bad dip where Dudley Road and Nichol Ave meet, that is destroying the front end of my car. Something really needs to be done about the dip by possibly filling it in with pavement or something. I brought this to the attention to facility maintenace before and never got a response. I hope you can helpI know paving isn\'t done in the winter time but hopefully by the spring something can be done. Nancy LaParo,staff,nlaparo,Busch,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,dirt path between ASB 1 lot (63A) to Busch Student center,There is a heavily used path from ASB I back parking lot to Bartholomew Road (towards Busch student center). It is very muddy. Staff and students use the path. It would be great if it could be paved (or throw down some gravel or wood chips).
Thanks (I know I\'m not a student but I saw the article in the Targum about repairs)
Sandy Esposito,2008,022006306,CollegeAve,College Avenue,Other,Rest rooms,Hardenberg and Campbell,The ladies rooms in both of these buildings are disgusting.

Krause,2010,dkrause,OffCampus,Douglass,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Walters Hall,The two cooling units on the roof of Walters are, literally, falling apart. pieces of metal are hanging off of the units and other pieces are on the roof. When the units are running, gallons of water are spilling from the units onto the roof below. Pools of standing water are held in check by tarp, but leaks are common in the offices below.

Darline Then,2011,116000965,Livingston,Livingston,Other,the carpets need to be vacummed,Quad 1, house 10, 1st floor,I think that the carpets in the halls should be vacummed, especially now since it has been raining and there are leaves everywhere. All of the dirt on the carpet can be transferred to our rooms when we walk on the carpet and this is not healthy for us to have uncleaned carpets for such a long period.Jennifer Hsueh,2011,115009344,Busch,Busch,Heating/Ventilation/Cooling,,Metzger Hall,After Thanksgiving Break, our heater has blown nothing but cold air.

Vedran Lalic,2009,vlalic,OffCampus,College Avenue,Structural Issues,,Alexander Library, 4th floor,In the studying area, in front of the Humanities and Social Sciences Data Center, the lights on the desks don`t work, since it is not possible to plug them into the ground outlet.

The ends of the plug have been bended.

When it gets dark out, it impossible to read and study in this area, since the students are not able to use something as fundamental as lights.

I don`t think it takes a lot to fix this problem; if you could, that would be great.

Thanks!Jasmine Greene,Junior,jasmineg,Livingston,Livingston,Other,Construction,Towers Atrium,There is construction going on in the south tower part of the atrium.  I was wondering if there is a limit on how early they can start drillling and disturbing the sleeping students.  I realize that this is not really a maintenance question, but I would like some feedback.  Maybe I am overreacting, maybe they should be able to work whenever they like.  However, they begin some mornings at 8am or earlier.  Shirley A.

Carla YanniTova Diamond,2009,072000945,OffCampus,Livingston,Technology,,\"Computer Lab\",I don\'t think it is reasonable to call the room with two computers and no printers a \"computer lab\". It is rare that I get a chance to use them as they are often occupied, and for the money I am paying in tuition to attend school here, there should be much more of a facility.Michael Puzio,2009,018-00-8472,OffCampus,College Avenue,Other,Cleaning & Housing Staff and R.U. Policy,College Ave. Dormitory Halls,In my four years at Rutgers, having lived and traversed the corridors and spaces of the dormitories on College Ave. and Livingston, I\'ve yet to witness that the staff employed to clean and maintain the halls and indoor areas actually follow Rutgers University policy. As according to N.J. state law and the rules of Rutgers, people are not only supposed to recycle and place trash within proper receptacles, but if and when others have already done so and it is your duty to remove that trash for proper retrieval and disposal, it is improper procedure to then lump it all together and throw it away collectively as the same garbage. Therefore it is my complaint, and urgent suggestion at a University that produces waste on the scale of a corporate compound or major city, that this somehow be rectified. Take time out to mandate a training session, explaining and bringing to the cleaning employees attention why it is necessary to follow proper waste disposal protocols and the ramifications of not doing so. Possibly showing data and statistical information may help, or distributing University produced pamphlets. Regardless, something should be done and there are innumerable means of easily changing this problem.Matthew Samuel,2010,msamuel2,OffCampus,Busch,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,Nichols Parking Lot Side Entrance,There is a decently large pothole right in the center of the side parking lot entrance/exit in the Nichols Apartments parking lot on Busch Campus.Jessica Court,2010,117004433,OffCampus,Douglass,Structural Issues,,Walters 251,there is a HUGE leak above my drafting table and subsequently my drafting projects are now ruined. I find it comepletely unacceptable that these leaks are obviously part of a bigger problam and have clearly never been addressed. My schoolwork is being affected by a lack of maintanence that is appauling considering teh amount of money I spend to attend this institution. Joel Whitehead,2008,joelw,OffCampus,Busch,Sidewalks/Paving/Street Marks/ Crosswalks,,Pavement Pathway adjacent to the Biomedical Engineering Building,There is 
a huge pothole in the field inbetween the lip of the curb and 
the blacktop pavement pathway adjacent to the new biomedical 
engineering building. The pot hole has grass inside of it so it is really hard
to see. I hit it on my bicycle and really hurt myself. (Part of me 
wanted to go fill it myself with a bag of concrete...) 
This is a small problem that shouldn\'t need that much time or money. please 
take care of it.
