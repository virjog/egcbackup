Here's your opportunity to create a uniqure design for engineers to wear on their shirts! Just keep in mind the following things:
<ol>
	<li>Due to legality issues, I ask that you please avoid using the School of Engineering seal. We will not use any aspect of it on the clothing, including the shield, and even the font. In fact, it is encouraged that you create designs for the general idea of Engineering, rather than focusing on only our school. They can be funny, witty, bold, prideful, anything that you can think of about engineers. However, if you prefer to work with School of Engineering ideas, we we will accept designs for that too, as long as you do not copy the school's logo or seal in any way.</li>
	<li>We only ask for designs intended for the front of the clothing, but if you ahve a good idea for the back, we'll consider it.</li>
	<li>For those who are concerned about the colors of the shirts and sweaters, we plan to use red, black, and either dark blue or gray. If you want your design on a specific color(s), please make note of that when you email your design.</li>
	<li>All submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:soeshirts@gmail.com">soeshirts@gmail.com</a> by Friday, November 2nd.</li>
	<li>We'll be choosing more than one design so the chances of your design being chosen aren't all that bad!</li>
	<li>If there are any mroe questions, feel free to email <a href="mailto:davechin@eden.rutgers.edu">David Chin</a>.
