In an effort to truly represent and benefit the constituency we represent, the EGC hosts many events that extend beyond the immediate council. Events are held through out the year, both large and small.<br />
<br />
<div style="padding-bottom: .8em;">Among our largest and most popular events are:</div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
	<a href="cup.html">The Engineering Cup</a><br />
	<div style="padding: 0px 0px .7em 25px;">
		The recently revived Engineering Cup is a competition of athletics and smarts between engineering departments, earning points through the year to claim bragging rights and the coveted Engineering Cup. Last years competitions included soccer, volleyball, and football, among others.
	</div>

	<a href="leadership_conf.html">Leadership Conference</a><br />
	<div style="padding: 0px 0px .7em 25px;">
		The Leadership Conference is an annual event held each spring, at which the EGC brings together the leaders of all Engineering Societies at Rutgers to help prepare next year's leaders by sharing experiences from the previous year. In addition to sessions, the EGC finds a keynote speaker as well as presents that year's EGC Teaching Awards.

	<a href="http://coewww.rutgers.edu/openhouse/" target="_blank">Engineering Open House</a><br />
	<div style="padding: 0px 0px .7em 25px;">
		The Engineering Open House is the School of Engineering’s largest recruitment effort aimed at attracting prospective high school students. The Engineering Governing Council is responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing the entire event. Preparation for this event begins in December and continues until a couple weeks after the event. The Engineering Open House must cater to as many as 1,000 students and parents during a single day.

	Freshmen Convocation<br />
	<div style="padding: 0px 0px .7em 25px;">
		The Freshman Convocation is aimed at bringing together all new students of the School of Engineering and introducing them to the Administration, Engineering Societies, and most importantly, other freshman engineers. Consider this to be a mixer, minus the drinks. Many of your future friends and colleagues will be there, and so should you.
